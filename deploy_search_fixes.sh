- Add fallback to load venues if array is empty
- Improve error handling with empty search term alerts
- Fix event listener timing with DOMContentLoaded wrapper

Show All neighborhood fix:
- Replace dead link with proper showAllVenuesWithResults function
- Display all venues on map and as browsable cards
- Update visual styling to highlight active selection
- Scroll to map for better user experience
